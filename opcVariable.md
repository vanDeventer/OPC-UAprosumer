Arrowhead Framework OPC-UA service prosumer:

OPC Variable Service

## Introduction
This provided service from the [OPC-UA](https://github.com/nenovrak/OPC-UAprosumer/blob/master/OPC%20Unified%20Architecture.pdf) service prosumer provides the information available from an OPC-UA enabled device.

## Service description
Provider will listen for incoming requests from Consumers wanting to read OPC-UA variables.
A Consumer can read an OPC-UA variable by making a HTTP GET request to the Provider sending it the OPC-UA endpoint, namespace, and variable it wishes to read.
These values are sent as URL parameters in the following way: 
```
HTTP GET {prosumerIP:port}/opcVariable/{OPC-UA_endpointIP:port}/{namespace}/{variableName}
```
Here *OPC-UA_endpointIP:port* is the IP and port to the [OPC-UA](https://github.com/nenovrak/OPC-UAprosumer/blob/master/OPC%20Unified%20Architecture.pdf) endpoint, *namespace* refers to the OPC-UA namespace one wishes to use, and *variableName* is the name of an variable within that namespace wrapped in double quotation marks (you might need to URL encode these using %22). An example of such an GET request to read the variable *xBG5* in namespace *3* can be found below:
```
HTTP GET {providerIP:port}/opcVariable/10.48.134.10:4840/3/%22xBG5%22
```

When the Provider receives a request, it will first assess whether there is already an open connection to that endpoint.
If not it will connect to the endpoint and keep that connection throughout the lifetime of the service. It will then read the requested OPC-UA variable and return its *value*, *type* and *timestamp* in a JSON object. An example output from the service is shown below:
